For my algorithim I chose, a mix between Z-Score and EMA.
The  Z-Score is a statistical measure that calculates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.
This Z-Score will be used to determine wether a value is normal or abnormal, however this alone would not be enough to determine the trend, 
so I used the EMA to smooth out the data and get a better view of trends and seasonal patterns. 
The Exponential Moving Average  (EMA) is a type of moving average typically used  in technical analysis of financial markets to smooth out price action by filtering out
the noise from random price fluctuations, the inclusion of EMA provides a way to more accuratley keep track of trends as it weighs recent data more heavily than older data.
And provides a non-static view of the data, which is useful for identifying seasonal patterns.

Together with these two methods, I implemented a rolling window which allows me to consider how a data point changes the average value of a set of datapoints.
This also helps in identifying seasonal trends, essentially we are creating a smaller dataset in the overall dataset and slowly adding the most recent datapoints and removing 
the older ones and then we can apply the Z-Score and EMA to this smaller dataset to see how the data point changes the average value of the set of datapoints.

There were many algorithims to consider , but this hybrid approach seemed to be the most effective for this problem because it uses a 
proven method of trackings seasonal data in EMA and uses a determisnistic method of identifying outliers in Z-Score. 
Other algorithims such as quantile regression, or even a simple moving average could have been used, but they would not have been as effective at 
determining trends and are more susceptible to noise in the data.
